# SFI reproducibility release (public) — v1.5.0
**Provenance note.** This v1.5.0 public release is built on the v1.4.7.1 baseline computation pipeline. v1.5.0 adds the derived-output pipeline pseudocode and a runnable demo/minimal reference implementation; the archived derived outputs and reported key numbers remain unchanged.

## How to cite

See `CITATION.cff` for the recommended citation metadata.

This release contains **derived, machine-readable outputs** that support the paper’s reported results, together with **minimal scripts** to re-generate the key summary numbers and table-like CSVs from the released derived outputs (CPU-only; no GPU required).
## Pseudocode specification (derived-output pipeline)

An implementation-independent pseudocode specification for the derived-output pipeline is provided in:
- `docs/DERIVED_OUTPUTS_PIPELINE_PSEUDOCODE.md`

This specification is intended to clarify the exact steps and parameters used to generate the released table-like CSVs from the archived derived outputs.

It is designed for **independent verification** of:
- dataset-level counts (e.g., number of evaluation images),
- metric/dimension configuration (8 metrics; 5 dimensions),
- directional summaries (how often *d*\_CN < *d*\_W),
- released tables used in the manuscript / Supplementary Tables.

> Note: The complete raw façade image corpus is not redistributed. A small author-collected demo image set is included under reference_impl_demo/ for the reference implementation.

## Quick start (CPU-only)

From the package root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/reproduce_key_numbers.py --root . --out repro_outputs
python scripts/reproduce_tables.py --root . --out repro_outputs/tables
```

Expected outputs:
- `repro_outputs/key_numbers.csv`
- `repro_outputs/tables/table_*.csv`

## Package contents

- `derived_outputs/distances/`
  - Long-form directional distances to the Chinese (`d*_CN`) and Western (`d*_W`) reference sets per image and metric.

- `derived_outputs/fusion/`
  - Baseline metric weights (subjective/objective/fused).

- `derived_outputs/dimfs/`
  - Dimension-level fused scores (DimFS) per image.

- `derived_outputs/validation/`
  - Released summaries for construct validity, direction-convergent checks, and stability diagnostics (relative CI).

- `docs/`
  - `DERIVED_OUTPUTS_PIPELINE_PSEUDOCODE.md`: implementation-independent pseudocode specification for the derived-output pipeline.

- `metadata/`
  - Controlled vocabularies and mapping tables used to normalise style/site labels for the public release.

- `scripts/`
  - Minimal reproducibility scripts to verify integrity (SHA-256) and regenerate key summary numbers and released table-like CSVs from the archived derived outputs.

- `reference_impl_demo/`
  - Optional lightweight demo / reference implementation for validating pipeline wiring and deterministic outputs (does not require the full raw-image corpus).

- `repro_outputs/`
  - Outputs generated by the reproducibility scripts (e.g., `repro_outputs/key_numbers.csv`, `repro_outputs/tables/table_*.csv`).

- `audit/` (optional)
  - Small audit artefacts supporting internal consistency checks (does not require raw images).

- Root files
  - `checksums_sha256.txt`: SHA-256 checksums for tracked files (integrity verification).
  - `environment.yml` / `requirements.txt`: minimal environment specifications.
  - `VERSION`: release version string.
  - `CITATION.cff`: citation metadata.
  - `CHANGELOG.md`: release notes.
  - `RUN_LOG_TEMPLATE.txt`: template for recording run metadata.

## File naming and identifiers

- A runlog-to-release mapping table is provided in `metadata/file_map.csv`.
- Site label normalisation is documented in `metadata/site_alias_map_v1.csv`.
- `image_uid` is the stable identifier used across derived tables (pattern: `<stem>|<stem>`).

## Integrity

SHA-256 checksums for all tracked files (excluding the checksum file itself) are provided in `checksums_sha256.txt`.

## License

Code in `scripts/` is released under the license in `LICENSE`. Data products in `derived_outputs/` are provided for verification and reuse subject to the terms described in the manuscript’s data availability statement.

## Environment (recommended)

This release includes a minimal `environment.yml` for conda.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate sfi-repro
```

You may also install via pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Compressed mirrors

For convenience, a compressed mirror is provided:
- `derived_outputs/distances/DIST_master_long_public_v1.csv.gz` (mirror of the `.csv` used by the scripts).


## One-command verification

```bash
python scripts/verify_release.py --root .
```

This will (i) verify SHA256 checksums and (ii) regenerate `key_numbers.csv` and released tables under `repro_outputs/`.
